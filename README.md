I am part of a lose global alliance of highly technical blockchain developers. I generally use the ledger itself instead 
of github, however I retroactively put code onto this medium for compatibility with more traditional. I have code in various
other repos. One of my first in called "unspendable" and explores systems of hacking data directly into bitcoin and altcoin. 
I also build sites which are intended to live in IPFS and act as a entry place with no single point of failure.

The boot element goes one step further in that it lives completely onchain as a stub marked by sending a transaction to the unspendable address:
0x1111-1111.

I will keep adding to this repo so it is a one-stop place to explain what I do. 

My latest completed IPFS effort is located here:

Again, these solutions don't particularly lend themselves to Github.
